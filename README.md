## Recently working on: 
* [Scaling DevTools](https://podcast.scalingdevtools.com/) - a DevTools growth podcast, we're on episode 50ish now
* AI Video clipping tool 

### Past experiments/small ideas
* [Magic Cache](https://magic-cache-app.vercel.app/)) - idea is to save money on your devtools openai bill by caching your existing completions. Built it. Got some "this is cool" reaction but not much in the way of actions
* [Super Simple Chat](https://github.com/jackbridger/super-simple-chat) - easier to build chat without locking yourself in. Not actually launched yet. 
* [Apptoggle](https://apptoggle.com/) - Make any React Native Screen A/B testable by your marketing team. Even after deployment. Got to #1 on r/reactnative but we couldn't find a strong pressing problem so moved on
* [A/B testing with Supabase](https://dev.to/jacksbridger/ab-split-your-users-with-supabase-kco) - an article experiment - no interest
* [In-app surveys made easy](https://surveyloop.co/) - idea to make no-code in app surveys developers like using. We still get some interest in this but I think neither of us felt that passionate about it.
* An AI video clip generator - I wrote all the code and didn't launch it. I think mostly because I realised I wanted to do a devtool.
* Easy football news in Japanese - translates a BBC article into [basic japanese for beginners](https://easy-japanese-news-football.tiiny.site/) and wrote up [an article on it](https://dev.to/jacksbridger/building-a-language-learning-tool-with-supabase-edge-functions-gpt35-3j8k)
* [Replicating WhatsApp in React Native article series](https://dev.to/jacksbridger/whatsapp-ui-in-react-native-part-1-4nbm)

### Some of my past actual projects:
* [Code at Uni](https://www.codeatuni.com/) - cofounded a company that taught students how to code. Moderate success, Â£450k+ lifetime revenue
* [iOS Dev Tools](https://iosdev.tools/) - a newsletter/site on tools for ios devs. bought it and ran it for a year and then re-sold it. Learned a lot. We had some moderate successful videos & a [GitHub](https://github.com/ios-dev-tools/awesome-ios-dev-tools?ref=blog.scalingdevtools.com) resource I [coded up using our data](https://blog.scalingdevtools.com/code-as-marketing-an-experiment/)
* [Just Alevel](https://justalevel.com/) - Computer Science revision for 16-18 year olds. The [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@justalevel5639) still gets views. Short story of why we stopped: burn out. 
* A mobile social network - the instagram for audio. Cofounded it as a 19 year old and we had some small early successes before it went bang. Learned a lot!

Outside of these, I'm currently doing contract work with TypeScript/React/Express for a very cool AR/VR startup.
